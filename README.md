# Github DM

### Description
Dear Developer, here you will find my implementation of the coding challenge.
It is hard to explain my thought process in a readme, so I hope we will have the chance to have some discussions :)

### How to use
Tested with
- XCode 12.3
- Swift 5.3

No dependencies, the project should just run.


### Features
- Offline ready
- Loads follower images
- Profile View and switch user
- Sending messages pushes the follower in the list to top
- Localized UI (English, German, Japanese)
- Light & Dark Mode

### Screenshots
Under the folder 'Screenshots' you can find screenhots where you can see the app in light/dark mode and other language.

### Architecture/Technology Choices
- MVVM
- Swift Combine
- UIKit
- Storyboard

### Unit Testing
I made some unit tests that should be in the same place as the view models

### Considerations
- Storyboards - Due to time constraints I have used one storyboard. In real projects I would either use a lot of seperated storyboards or generally setup the UI completely in code.


### Functional Requirements:
